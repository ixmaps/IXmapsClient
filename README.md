# IXmaps Client
`v1.0` released December 7, 2015

**IXmapsClient** is an internet mapping tool that allows you to see how your personal data travels across the internet by generating traceroute data to determine the paths packets take. Users' contributions are submitted to the ixmaps.ca server where they are visualized geographically for public display and analysis.

IXmapsClient is based on node.js and sets up a web server that only answers queries from your host, then opens a browser page to access the interface. IXmapsClient runs on port 2040.

The application is available at:

## Installation and Running
IXmapsClient_v.1.0 works on **Mac OS X** and **Linux**, if you are interested in a Windows version please contact us.

### Mac OS X
This version of the software has been tested and runs on Mac OS X:
* 10.6
* 10.7
* 10.8
* 10.9
* 10.10

The current version of the client can be downloaded from [www.ixmaps.ca/contribute](https://www.ixmaps.ca/contribute.php).

1. Double click on the IXmapsClient_v.1.0.dmg to open it
2. Drag the IXmapsClient.app application to your Applications folder
3. Drag the IXmapsClient.command to your Desktop
4. To launch double click on IXmapsClient.command

#### Installation Note:
Depending on your Security & Privacy settings, OS X may disallow installation of the IXmapsClient. This is part of OS X called “[Gatekeeper](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491),” to adjust these settings please open **Apple menu > System Preferences… > Security & Privacy > General tab** and under the header **"Allow applications downloaded from"** select **Anywhere**.

**IXmapsClient** needs to be executed in a terminal with administrator's privileges. For this reason, when double clicking **IXmapsClient.command**, a new terminal window will be opened asking for the administrator's password.

Type the password and press return. This will open **IXmapsClient** on your default internet browser.

#### Removing IXmapsClient
1. Move the **IXmapsClient.app** application from your **Applications** folder to the Trash
2. Move the **IXmapsClient.command** icon from your **Desktop** to the Trash

This will completely remove the IXmaps Client from your computer  


### Linux
To be added


### Installation Note
As of December 7, 2015 IXmaps has moved to using IXmapsClient instead of TRgen to collect routing information.

The Mac OS X and Linux versions of TRgen are deprecated. To install the **Windows** version of TrGen, download the Windows installer [from here](https://www.ixmaps.ca/TrGen/trgen-0.8.8.msi) and follow the instructions. You will not need administrator privileges to run the software once installed, but you may need to be logged into an administrator account to install it.

## Development
Contributions to improve the IXmaps Client are welcome!

### Install and build packages
IXmaps Client is based on node.js. For installation, https://github.com/creationix/nvm seems to work well. Once installed, use `nvm install iojs`

You will also need appropriate build tools for your OS installed (eg build-essentials, or on Mac OS, the basic XCode).

Then:

`$ npm install -g gulp && npm install && gulp build && npm run-script webpack-production`

### Executing

#### Run the server

Since you're accessing raw sockets, you must run as root (eg sudo). Make sure your root user has node available.

`# npm start`

This should also launch your web browser pointing to the local TRgen interface. If the interface can't be opened, you can manually go to http://localhost:2040

IXnode can also be run as a public service, which should be used with caution. `npm run-script public`.

### Packaging

#### Command line execution

`# node trace-raw`

use -h for help.
